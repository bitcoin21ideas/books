# books

This is a very early stage project aimed to provide access to the essential books on Bitcoin, economics and sovereignty to everyone across the world. While the work of the authors is priceless, there is an issue with books destribution. Millions of people across the world do not have access to Amazon web store, USD bank cards or any other traditional payments mechanisms. 

This project aims to combine the best of both worlds by gathering all the fundamental books in one place while providing an opportunity for everyone to thank the authors by sending them a few sats for their efforts.

More info regarding future plans is coming.
