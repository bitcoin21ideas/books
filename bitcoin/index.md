# Bitcoin books

This is a folder with the most prominent must-read Bitcoin books. All the books are freely accesssible in this repository or can be downloaded by crushing a flexible paywall, that can be as low as 1 sat. There are too many jurisdictions, where people are unable to purchase and hence get access to these fundamental materials. 
However, you can find a lightning- and Nostr address of each author next to the book, and everyone is encouraged to send the amount of sats which you find fit. 
This will send the best signal possibe to the authors, proving their work is valuable and stimulating them to continue doing what they do best.

Consider using my Nostree page to navigate the books and optionally send some sats prior to downloading books. 


DISCLAIMER:
10% of sats will be collected by yours truly to help me maintain this project and hopefully turn it into a convenient recource to read, download and share essential knowledge, as well as support favorite authors. 

Available books:
